## Svelte + Vite Pixel App

[![pixel app](image-url)](/src/assets/screenshot.png)

This app allows you to color in squares of a grid and create your own design

You can choose between three different design modes: paint, fill, and erase

As these grids are often used for crochet, the app also features a 'crochet mode' that highlights individual rows to help you keep track white crocheting/knitting
